`growInX` is a matrix animation where containers scale along the x-direction, commonly used for G.Group container animations. It affects the graphic's `transform.scale` property.

## Getting Started

<img alt="growInX" src="https://gw.alipayobjects.com/mdn/rms_f5c722/afts/img/A*vhRVSLxDqU8AAAAAAAAAAABkARQnAQ" width="400" />

```ts
chart
  .interval()
  /* ... */
  .animate('enter', { type: 'growInX' });
```
